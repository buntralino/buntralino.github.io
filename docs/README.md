## How does it work?
Buntralino is a hybrid app development framework that lets you use web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript) to make desktop apps. Buntralino applications work by creating a Bun application that launches and manages Neutralino.js windows. Neutralino.js windows can exchange information with Bun and each other in a client-server model through websockets, with you using a nice promise-based API. Bun is a faster alternative to Node.js or Deno, while Neutralino.js uses native OS' browser and augments it with native functions.

## Get started

### Make a new Buntralino project
```sh
bun install -g buntralino-cli
buntralino create
```
### Or, turn the existing Neutralino.js app into a Buntralino project
```sh
bun install -g buntralino-cli
buntralino add
```
### Run the application
```sh
buntralino run
```
### Build the app
```sh
buntralino build
```
That's it! Buntralino will manage building and packaging and uses `neutralino.config.json` Neutralino.js uses.

# Buntralino website

This is a Vuepress-powered website published at buntralino.github.io for the Buntralino project.

Buntralino unites Bun and Neutralino.js to make a simpler, lighter alternative to Electron and NW.js. Use Neutralino.js API at client and send harder tasks to Bun while keeping your development process easy.

## Development

git clone https://github.com/buntralino/buntralino.github.io.git

npm install
```

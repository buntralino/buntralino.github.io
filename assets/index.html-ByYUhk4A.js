Buntralino applications work by creating a Bun application that launches and manages Neutralino.js windows. Neutralino.js windows can exchange information with Bun and each other in a client-server model through websockets, with you using a nice promise-based API. Bun is a faster alternative to Node.js or Deno, while Neutralino.js uses native OS' browser and augments it with native functions."}],"footer":"MIT Licensed | Copyright Â© 2024-present Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://buntralino.github.io/"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Buntralino"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Home"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-12-17T12:40:30.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-12-17T12:40:30.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"WebPage\\",\\"name\\":\\"Home\\"}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1734145541000,"updatedTime":1734439230000,"contributors":[{"name":"Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych","username":"Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych","email":"admin@nersta.ru","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/Cosmo Myzrail Gorynych"}]},"filePathRelative":"README.md","localizedDate":"December 14, 2024"}`);export{c as comp,p as data};
